            <p> What does fostering a dog involve?<br><br>
                When you foster, you agree to take a homeless dog into your home and give him or her love, care and attention, either for a predetermined period of time or until the dog is adopted.<br><br>
                
            
                
                Why do adoption groups need foster homes?<br><br>
                There are many reasons a dog might need foster care. Some of the most common include:<br><br>
                
                A rescue group doesn’t have a physical shelter and depends on foster homes to care for dogs until suitable homes are found.<br>
                A puppy is too young to be adopted and needs a safe place to stay until he or she is old enough to go to a forever home.<br>
                A dog is recovering from surgery, illness or injury and needs a safe place to recuperate.<br>
                A dog is showing signs of stress such as pacing or hiding in the shelter.<br>
                A dog has not lived in a home before or has not had much contact with people and needs to be socialized.<br>
                The shelter is running out of room for adoptable dogs.<br><br>
                How do I sign up to foster a dog?<br><br>
                Find a rescue group or shelter near you and contact them. <br>They’ll likely have you fill out a foster application and, if you are approved, they will work with you to figure out the right foster dog for your household.</p>
